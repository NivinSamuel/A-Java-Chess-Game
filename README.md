# A-Java-Chess-Game

Title: Java Chess Game

Overview:
This project implements a chess game in Java, providing a graphical interface for players to interact with the game board and pieces. It includes the basic rules of chess, such as movement, capturing, check, checkmate, stalemate, and pawn promotion.

Key Features:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - The game features a graphical interface built using Java's Swing library, allowing players to interact with the chessboard visually.
   - The GUI includes the chessboard itself, represented by squares and pieces, providing a user-friendly experience.

2. Object-Oriented Design:
   - The project demonstrates strong object-oriented design principles by encapsulating chess pieces and their behaviors within individual classes.
   - Each chess piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) is represented by a separate class, inheriting common properties and methods from a base Piece class.
   - The Board class manages the layout of the chessboard and enforces the rules of the game.

3. Game Logic:
   - The game implements core chess rules, including legal moves for each piece type, capturing opponent pieces, and identifying game states such as check, checkmate, and stalemate.
   - It accurately simulates the movement of chess pieces based on their type-specific rules and current board positions.

4. User Interaction:
   - Players can interact with the game using mouse input, selecting and moving pieces across the board.
   - The game provides visual feedback to indicate valid and invalid moves, as well as the current turn and game status.

5. Special Moves and Conditions:
   - Special chess moves such as castling and pawn promotion are supported, enhancing the realism and complexity of the game.
   - The project handles edge cases and exceptional conditions, ensuring a robust and accurate chess-playing experience.

Technical Details:

- The project is structured into multiple classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game, such as Piece, Board, and GamePanel.
- It utilizes ArrayLists to manage collections of chess pieces and facilitates efficient iteration and manipulation of game state.
- Threading is employed to implement a game loop, ensuring smooth animation and responsiveness of the GUI.
- Graphics2D is used for rendering the game elements, providing flexibility and control over visual presentation.

Future Enhancements:

1. Improved User Interface: Enhance the graphical interface with additional features such as highlighting legal moves, displaying captured pieces, and providing player feedback.
2. AI Opponent: Implement an artificial intelligence opponent to enable single-player mode against the computer.
3. Online Multiplayer: Integrate network capabilities to support online multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other remotely.
4. Customization Options: Add options for customizing the appearance of the chessboard and pieces, as well as adjusting game settings and difficulty levels.
